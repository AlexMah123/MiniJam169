## Description
You play as a vigilante trying to stop the city of crime. But the police are on your tail. Manage your resources and try to survive without being caught for your "altruism"

## Concept
Taken from WWE TCG (prematch), the idea was to have decisions available that would affect the game environment. So basically Batman Arkham. But yeah!
